# Deploy To SharePoint VSTS Build Step #

### What is this repository for? ###

When developing SharePoint add-ins you typically need to deploy the add-in to a SharePoint online tenant upon successful build. This is 
a Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) Custom build step enabling just that.

Simply configure the build step with details about the SharePoint tenant and your add-in will be deployed automatically
